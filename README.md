# Medical-Image-Analysis-with-CNN
## Chest X-Ray Images

### This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze medical images, like X-rays or MRIs, for disease detection or identifying abnormalities. Starting with a dataset exploration phase, such as the Chest X-Ray Images dataset, you will conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data better, looking at correlations between features and identifying outliers or missing values.
